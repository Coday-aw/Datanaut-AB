- **Members Present:** Johan, Björn, Sepideh, Coday
- **Sprint goal (weekly todo):**  
  - Create a full ER Diagram
  - Normalize to 3NF
  - Write backlog with user stories and break down into tasks
- **What we did:** We kept on working on the ER Diagram - we are still having issues forming a working picture in our heads. We feel we understand the needs of the database, we just struggle putting in into documentation. We are hoping to be able to show and discuss our probably faulty design with Malin to learn how we should be thinking. The stories we have from last week. We feel that it's a bit hard to break down the stories further without going further into the development.
- **Problems/Hurdles:** Still struggling with understanding cardinalities in ER Diagrams

  -First draft of ER-diagram, list of requirements and the beginning of a backlog with user stories 
- **What we did:** We started with assigning roles to the different people in our group and and made a github, after that we made a ER-diagram together
- **Problems/Hurdles:** The tasks we got were a bit broad and the DoD was not entirely easy to understand so we were unsure if we were done or not.
