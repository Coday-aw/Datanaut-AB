- **Deltagare (närvaro):** Johan, Björn, Sepideh, Coday
- **Sprintmål (veckans DoD):** First draft of ER-diagram, list of requirements and the beginning of a backlog with user stories 
- **Vad vi gjorde:** We started with assigning roles to the different people in our group and and made a github, after that we made a ER-diagram together

- **Problem/hinder:** The tasks we got were a bit broad and the DoD was not entirely easy to understand so we were unsure if we were done or not.
